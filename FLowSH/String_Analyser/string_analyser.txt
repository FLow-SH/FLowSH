How to use the String Analyser:

1. Apply a string sanitisation function
2. Check if the string detected has any metacharacter. To do so, check if the original string is 
    different from the sanitised string. If so then there was a sanitisation.
3.1 If there is a sanitisation, check if the string is already on the LSH database, if not insert
    MinHash of string and alert SOC.
3.2 If there is no sanitisation, alert SOC of false positive.
